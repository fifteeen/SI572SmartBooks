This is one possible solution to the practical midtem. Things to note here:

1. The code is heavilly commented and you don't need to be this extreme;
2. Indentation of code;
3. PHP is inserted between HTML codes;
4. Various naming conventions:
    * All session variables start with ses
    * Name of form elements have different prefixes depending on their types:
        + Button starts with btn
        + Text input starts with txt
        + Hidden elements starts hdn
5. Notice the schema.sql file, which is the SQL script to create my database.
